jQuery.dragScroller
===================

Scroll screen like a boss on touch screen monitors!

# Usage

    $('selector').dragScroller();

The parent for this selector will be the cointainer, so it must have fixed width and height.
The inner content size can be illimited, is the content that will be scrolled.
For now this plugin only scrolls vertical.
